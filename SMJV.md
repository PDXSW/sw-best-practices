Speakers, Mentors, Judges, Volunteers
===
Mentors
---
* Don’t mentor teams to death!  Have fewer mentors spend the whole weekend.
* Feedback from teams is not to have mentors interrupt all the time
* Ideally 10-12 mentors per weekend
###Preparation

* Mentors need to be trained on what the judging criteria is
* PDXSW has seen teams be derailed by mentors who sent them in the wrong directions
* Mentors need to be an on-demand resource during the weekend
###Selection
* Select the right mentors in the in the beginning.  Base selection off of judging criteria (remember!  there are four criteria now).
* Previous startup experience is key
* Pull mentors from organizations in your area like incubators/accelerators or sponsors
* Or pull from other areas to get a broader experience
* Sometimes sponsors think they get to be mentors automatically - be careful with this.  Guide them in the right direction.
###Outreach
###Meet and greet
###Firing
* Mentors promoting their own businesses
* Abusive behavior of any kind

Speakers
---
* Give speakers guidance on format of speech.  Ask them what they plan to talk about to ensure that it meets the desired goal.
* Be sure to give the speaker a gift
* Always have a backup speaker in case someone drops out
###Friday
* After dinner, but before pitches
* Someone who will energize the crowd for the weekend (e.g., prominent local entrepreneur)
###Sunday
* After dinner, but before presentations
* Someone who will give the crowd hope on what’s after startup weekend

Judges
---
* Choose judges that represent the audience.  Choose 3 or 5, but not more.  Entrepreneurs, not VCs.  A good breadth of background experience.  Past experience of success.
	* Judges from incubators/accelerator, pros and cons.  Could be biased to picking the winner.
	* Pick judges that have been vouched for by someone in the community.
	* Watch out for judges that have a conflict outside of the event.
* Training: Review judging criteria prior (see judging criteria form on Dropbox), prizes to be awarded, answer any questions.
* Be sure to have a dedicated area for judges to sit.  Have a notepad and water available for them.
* Encourage judges to use scores as a guide, not an absolute, in choosing the winner(s).

Volunteers
---
* 2 to man the front desk, 1 for assistance to logistics, 1 for food service
* Use shift blocks.  More in busy times, fewer during low times.
	* 8am-Noon, Noon-4:00pm, 4:00pm-8:00pm, 8:00pm-Close
* Be careful with volunteers who are also participants.
* PDXSW uses the rule that you have to have someone cover your volunteer duties.
