Alumni Network
===

Goal: Create a vibrant community of PDXSW alums that regularly communicate, help each other, and work together on new projects.

##Tools
* LinkedIn
	* Create a group and restrict membership to previous attendees, speakers, mentors, judges, volunteers, sponsors, and organizers. 
	* Allow free communication (unmoderated) for all members
	* Announce community and member-related projects 
	* Self-promotion is allowed, as long as it's on-topic and not annoying
* Mailchimp
	* Create a mailing list of all previous attendees, speakers, mentors, judges, volunteers, sponsors, and organizers.
	* This tool automates opt-in/out and allows for styling and analytics
	* Communicate out major events, partnerships, updates.
* Facebook
	* Create a Facebook group to announce our and partner events
	* Owned by Organizers
	* No self-promotion
* Twitter
	* Create a Twitter account to announce happenings.
	* Easy to just mirror Facebook account

##Events
* Plan for monthly alumni meetups between events. This assumes  2 events / year; dial this down for more events.
* Part social and part informative. Provide refreshments and networking time. Create a learning opportunity as well (pitch practice, learning exercise, etc?)
* Budget comes from nearest previous event
