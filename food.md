Food, Drinks, Snacks
====================

Goal
----
* You are serving seven meals. Food should be nutritious, tasty, on-time.
* People should not have to seek food outside the event.
* Take food preferences seriously. People remember good food, even if other things go bad.
* Communal meals facilitate networking, mentorship.

Menu Selection
--------------
* Required field for food preference during Eventbrite signup.
* What you will find: Vegan, Vegetarian, Kosher, Halal, Paleo, Gluten Free, Lactose Intolerance, Food Allergies (onion, mayo)
* Brain work requires brain food. Meals should include proteins, especially for vegan/vegetarian.
* Food preferences extend to meals, snacks, drinks.
* Healthy snacks such as fruit, nuts, popcorn, should be available. Buy in bulk.
* Assign specific meal to a person, or the food gets taken by others who do not have that preference.

Food Setup/Prep
---------------
* Separate special food, particularly where allergies are involved. For example, separate gluten free toaster, separate vegetarian/vegan utensils.
* If someone is GF due to Celiac disease, need to order food from a certified kitchen.
* Buy in bulk where you can: snacks, condiments, drinks.

Vendor Selection
----------------
* Some vendors require payment immediately.
* Always require receipts on food delivery.
* Develop long-term relationships with your food vendor. Work with vendors that will work with your food preferences, etc.

Drinks
------
* Minimum: Soft drinks and water
* Better: Energy drinks, juice, milk
* Coca Cola sponsorship : http://register.startupweekend.org/coca-cola/

Alcohol
-------
* Assign one person to serve during meals.
* Venue may limit alcohol. Be respectful of this and ask attendees to do the same.
* Limit alcohol to people who are getting drunk. We like to have fun, but SW is not a bar.
* Young people sometimes come to SW. Please ensure they are not served alcohol. Hire a licensed bartender if you can.
* For sponsor mixer, provide local spirits.
