Sponsorships and Prizes
=======================

Outreach
--------
* Start sponsorship as early as possible.  At least 3 months ahead. 
	+ Be building relationships year round
* Have a specific ask.  What sponsorship level do you want them to come in at? 
	+ For big sponsors: go straight to the big contact.  Tie it to a goal of the sponsor (e.g. Salesforce was opening a new office and needed to do recruitment).
* Don’t worry about proving cash ROI on sponsorship dollars, focus on intangible ROI.
* Tip: Work with student entrepreneur clubs to help raise sponsorship

Payment Collection
------------------
* Sponsorship dollars must go to SW.org headquarters
* After agreement to sponsor, follow up!  Send an invoice (see template from HQ, see Dropbox).  Direct sponsors on how they can make a payment: online or check.
* Get an accounting of what has been received by HQ.  If payments are late, send reminders to sponsors to make a payment.

In-kind vs. Cash
----------------
* Focus on cash first, then in-kind.
* In-kind lower value than cash level.  Be sure in-kind is useful for the event or the attendees.
* Sponsorship levels are set by HQ and should not be changed.  Try and use the same name as directed by HQ.

Sponsor Mixer
-------------
* Invite sponsors to come to the event at a specific time; 3:00pm on Sat
* Introduce sponsors and SMJs to each other
* Help communicate where their sponsorship dollars are going
* Great positive feedback from those that attend

Communications
--------------
* Use sales techniques.  Use a Kanban chart to track progress.
* Get a logo.  Get a description.  Is there a blog post to announce? 
	+ Tip: ask the sponsor to write their own blog post
* Before: Clearly communicate event times and when it’s okay to come. 
	+ Tip: Tell sponsors Friday night, VIP mixer, and Sunday night are best if they want to come.
* During: Keep sponsors engaged through social media during the event.
* After: Send thank yous after.  Tell them what happened at the event.

Prizes
------
* Match prizes to judging criteria!
* Ensure prize packages are ready to hand out to teams
* Hand out prize packages to winners and all other team leads
* What works for prizes:
	+ Things that help the team move forward
	+ Things that are useful to the whole team
	+ Stay away from something that can only be used by one person.
